# Steps to re\-platform<a name="ibm-re-platform"></a>

 The following procedure shows how you can migrate an [IBM MQ](ibm-mq-typical-architecture.md) to an equivalent Amazon MQ without impacting *App 1* or *App 2*: 

1. Create an [active/standby broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/active-standby-broker-deployment) in *us\-east\-1* and another in *us\-east\-2* named as **AMQ\_ORANGE** and **AMQ\_APPLE**\.

1. Create a *Network Bridge* between 2 brokers by adding a duplex network connector definition to one of the queues:

   ```
   <networkConnectors> 
       <networkConnector duplex="true" name="connector_AMQ_ORANGE_to_AMQ_APPLE" uri="masterslave:(ssl://b-d63bcc4d-682b-40a2-8227-31386bcf1e3d-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617,ssl://b-d63bcc4d-682b-40a2-8227-31386bcf1e3d-2.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617)" userName="amqadmin"/> 
   </networkConnectors>
   ```

    After the reboot of **AMQ\_ORANGE**, there should be a Network Bridge created between both brokers as illustrated below: ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/migration-guide/images/ibm-replatform-fig-1.PNG) ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/migration-guide/images/ibm-replatform-fig-2.PNG) 
**Note**  
Steps 1 and 2 can be replicated using a AWS CloudFormation template\. For more information about using AWS CloudFormation to set up Amazon MQ brokers, see the Amazon MQ [ AWS CloudFormation Template Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_AmazonMQ)\.

1.  Log in to IBM MQ Queue Manager Host and list the queues/topics definitions\. In **QM\_ORANGE**, you can list the queues and topics from IBM MQ using the following command: 

   ```
   $ sudo dmpmqcfg -m QM_ORANGE -t queue -o 1line | 
       grep -v "SYSTEM" | 
       grep -v "AUTHREC" | 
       grep -v "*" | 
       gawk -F: '{ print $1 }â€˜
   ```

    The output: 

   ```
   DEFINE QREMOTE('Q1') RQMNAME('QM_APPLE') RNAME('Q1') XMITQ('QM_APPLE') REPLACE 
   DEFINE QLOCAL('Q2') DISTL(NO) MAXDEPTH(5000) REPLACE 
   DEFINE QLOCAL('QM_APPLE') GET(DISABLED) MAXDEPTH(5000) USAGE(XMITQ) REPLACE
   ```

    In the example above, `Q1` is the link to the remote queue, `QM_APPLE` is the transit queue, and `Q2` is the local queue\. We only need local queue `Q2` for the Amazon MQ setup, which can be defined in the broker configuration as `<queue physicalName="Q2"/> ` 

    `Q1` is a local queue on `QM_APPLE` and `Q2` is a local queue in `QM_ORANGE`\. You can these resources accordingly in **AMQ\_APPLE** and **AMQ\_ORANGE** by using the following configuration 

   ```
   <destinations>
       <queue physicalName="localQ1"/>
   </destinations>
   ```

   Similairly, get the list of queues and topics from `QM_APPLE`\.

1.  Manually create a dead letter queue strategy in the AMQ configuration file\. 

    The defaultdead letter queue in ActiveMQ is called `ActiveMQ.DLQ`\. All un\-deliverable messages will get routed to this queue\. To streamline this process, you can set up an `individualDeadLetterStrategy` in the destination policy map of the `activemq.xml` configuration file, allowing you to specify a specific dead letter queue prefix for a given queue or topic\. You can apply this strategy using a wild\-card so that all queues can be set up with their own dead\-letter queues, as is shown in the example below: 

   ```
   <broker> 
       <destinationPolicy>
           <policyMap>
               <policyEntries> 
                   <!-- Set the following policy on all queues using the '>' wildcard --> 
                   <policyEntry queue=">"> 
                       <deadLetterStrategy> 
                           <!-- Use the prefix 'DLQ.' for the destination name, and make the DLQ a queue rather than a topic --> 
                           <individualDeadLetterStrategy queuePrefix="DLQ." useQueueForQueueMessages="true"/> 
                       </deadLetterStrategy> 
                   </policyEntry> 
               </policyEntries> 
           </policyMap> 
       </destinationPolicy> 
   </broker>
   ```
**Note**  
 **Dead\-Letter queue expiration \- **By default, ActiveMQ will **never** expire messages sent to a Dead\-Letter Queue \(DLQ\)\. However, beginning with ActiveMQ 5\.12, the `deadLetterStrategy` supports an expiration attribute whose value is given in milliseconds as shown below:   

   ```
   <broker>    
       <destinationPolicy>
           <policyMap>
               <policyEntries>
                   <policyEntry queue="QueueWhereItIsOkToExpireDLQEntries">
                       <deadLetterStrategy>
                           <.... expiration="300000"/>
                       </deadLetterStrategy>
                   </policyEntry>
               </policyEntries>
           </policyMap>
       </destinationPolicy>
   </broker>
   ```

1.  Create local queue `Q1` on **AMQ\_ORANGE** and `Q2` on **AMQ\_APPLE** as shown in the following: ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/migration-guide/images/ibm-replatform-fig-3.PNG) ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/migration-guide/images/ibm-replatform-fig-4.PNG)
